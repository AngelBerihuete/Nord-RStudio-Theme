Nord RStudio Theme

This theme is for the RStudio IDE. It is based off of the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports) color pallets and inspired by the RStudio theme  created by David Aja that can be found [here](https://github.com/edavidaja/nord-rstudio). The main differences are that the background is lighter and the comments are brighter, so they are easier to see.
